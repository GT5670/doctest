== (Optional) Integrating GitLab 

.Prerequisites

* You must have the necessary permissions to create and manage GitLab jobs.

*  You must have a GitLab API token. You can also integrate your own GitLab host. For that you must have your own GitLab host URL, if you do not provide the GitLab host, the system defaults to gitlab.com.

.Procedure

. In your CLI, make sure you are in the `rhtap-cli` directory.

+
[source,bash]
--
$ cd ~/rhtap-cli
--

. Run the integration command. Replace $API_TOKEN with your GitLab API token, $HOST_URL with you Jenkins instance URL. If you do not have a $HOST_URL, remove this part of the command.

+
[source,bash]
--
$ ./bin/rhtap-cli integration gitlab --token="$API_TOKEN" --host="$HOST_URL"
--
