== Deep dive into {ProductShortName}'s security tools

Ensuring the security of software throughout its development is essential for mitigating potential vulnerabilities. The {ProductShortName} leverages a powerful suite of tools designed to bolster your security measures. Let’s explore how {ProductShortName} utilizes its components — {RHDHShortName}, {RHTASShortName}, and {RHTPAShortName} — to provide a robust defense against security threats.

*{RHDHLongName} ({RHDHShortName})*

* {RHDHLongName} serves as a self-service portal for developers. It streamlines the onboarding process and offers access to a wealth of resources and tools necessary for secure software development. This platform encourages best practices and facilitates the integration of security measures right from the start of the development process.

*{RHTASLongName} ({RHTASShortName})*

* {RHTASLongName} focuses on enhancing software integrity through signature and attestation mechanisms. By ensuring that every piece of code and every artifact is signed and attested, {RHTASShortName} provides a verifiable trust chain that confirms the authenticity and security of the software components being used.

*{RHTPALongName} ({RHTPAShortName})*

* {RHTPALongName}, deals with the generation and management of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs). SBOMs are critical for maintaining transparency and compliance, as they provide a detailed list of all components, libraries, and dependencies included in a software product. {RHTPAShortName} automates the creation of SBOMs, ensuring that stakeholders have accurate and up-to-date information on the software’s composition.

== Leveraging ready-to-use software templates

{ProductShortName} offers ready-to-use software templates, embedding security directly into the development workflow, thus allowing developers to concentrate on innovation while minimizing security related distractions. These ready-to-use software templates are fully customizable, ensuring they meet your organization's unique requirements seamlessly.

Benefit from integrated features right out of the box:

* *{RHACSLongName} ({RHACSShortName}):* Strengthens your deployments against vulnerabilities.

* *Quay:* Provides a secure repository for your container images.

* *Tekton pipelines:* Enables precision in automated deployments.

* *GitOps:* Maintains consistency and automated configuration management.
