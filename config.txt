====
The name of your pipeline job must be the same as the application for which you are adding the Jenkins CI. If the names do not match, the pipeline will run on Jenkins but will not be visible on {RHDHShortName}.

.. (Optional) If you want to want to use a different pipeline name, update the `jenkins.io/job-full-name` in the `catalog-info.yaml` in the source repo for the pipeline name you decided.

. Select *OK* to create the job.
