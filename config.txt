if your Jenkins is on a non-local OpenShift instance, and your Rekor and TUF services are on different clusters, you need to update the `REKOR_HOST` and `TUF_MIRROR` environment variables in the *env.sh* file. This way your external Jenkins server will be able to communicate with Rekor and TUF installed with {ProductShortName}. It'll allow {ProductShortName} to sign container images correctly while running a Jenkins pipeline and avoid this link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_trusted_application_pipeline/1.2/html-single/release_notes_for_red_hat_trusted_application_pipeline_1.2/index#known-issues_default[known issue].

To update the `REKOR_HOST` and `TUF_MIRROR` variables:
+
.. Go to the *skeleton > ci > jenkins > rhtap* and open *env.sh*. The default values are:
+
----
REKOR_HOST=http://rekor-server.rhtap-tas.svc
TUF_MIRROR=http://tuf.rhtap-tas.svc
----
+
.. Replace the `.svc` ending with your OpenShift cluster URL that you run {ProductShortName} on. `.svc` means the local cluster and can be used by internal services but not by your external Jenkins. 
+
The correct routes of the Rekor and TUF services are printed as part of the installation process of {ProductShortName}. If these data arenâ€™t available to you, run this command and select the Rekor and TUF routes in the output: 
+
----
oc get routes -n rhtap-tas
----
+
An example of a full Rekor server URL:

Additionally, to enable ACS scans, set the `export DISABLE_ACS` to `false` in *env.sh*.
