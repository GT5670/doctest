Met with Josef today. Following are the findings from our conversation:


1. Setting up GitHub application - This is where things almost always got wrong and team always has too many questions on these.Â 

2. Tokens - Too many services, and they all require different tokens. So a lot of tokens to use and manage. For example, GitHub - It has different tokens for Organization, Repository, and Personal access. Team is most of the times confused on what tokens to use.

3. Lots of moving pieces and servcies to track - With many products getting integrated, we have a situation where we have keep track of many moving pieces, to provide a wholesome experience.

4. Common issues - A document should be there that lists common issues that a user may experience in RHTAP. Testing team has their own version of this doc.
