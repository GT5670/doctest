Once a PR is merged, the app analyses the code changes. Based on the backend logic, which includes mapping of the .yaml file to the .adoc files, it searches for the .adoc files that might contain the content related to the code changes. If multiple code files are changed, we can have multiple doc files which the system analyses and displayed at the same time. If it identifies a gap or missing content based on the LLM we have used, it highlights the gap and offers suggestions. These suggestions are based on t he document flow, the style in which the doc is written, and other relevant factors.
