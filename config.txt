Jenkins agent has installed the necessary binaries - `git`, `curl`, `jq`, `yq`, `buildah`, `syft`, `cosign`, `python3`, and `tree` - required to run the {RHTAPShortName} pipeline. You can verify the binaries after you run a pipeline and if it fails at the very beginning you can review the pipeline run to find the missing binaries.
