.Prerequisites

* You have used the forked repository URL from link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/tssc-sample-templates[tssc-sample-templates] during the {ProductShortName} install process.

* You have already forked and cloned the https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/tssc-sample-jenkins.git[tssc-sample-jenkins] pipeline template.

* You must ensure your forked version is well up to date and in sync with the upstream repository.

.Procedure

. Clone your forked `tssc-sample-templates` repository, and then open it in your preferred text editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

. For Jenkins only: Navigate to *skeleton > ci > jenkins* and open *Jenkinsfile*. Replace the `remote` URL with the URL of your forked repository. For example, remote: 'https://github.com/<username>/tssc-sample-jenkins.git'.

.. If your Jenkins is non local OpenShift, and your REKOR_HOST and TUF_MIRROR are on different clusters, you must update the corresponding URLs for the REKOR_HOST and TUF_MIRROR by going to *skeleton > ci > jenkins > rhtap* and opening *env.sh*.
